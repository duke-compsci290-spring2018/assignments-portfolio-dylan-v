This is a basic quiz application that uses the Vue framework and Node.js for data parsing. Users may pick a quiz from a list of quizzes, answer questions, and revisit questions they got wrong. Data is loaded using JSON files that contain the quiz names, questions, and the index of the correct question. At the end, a user's score is computed and displayed.

My biggest challenge was attempting to use Vue components. I ended up just using the Vue.app without components. I also had issues setting up Node.js with GitHub, but this was pretty common.

For help, I frequently referenced Vue documentation, watched all of the relevant lectures, and referenced TAs for help during lab.
