CSSZEN Project - Due 1/30/18

On this project I manipulated the CSS corresponding to two html files. 

The first file, zen1.html, includes a minimalist design where the sidebar is positioned on the left side of the information. When hovering over the sidebar, a color change can be detected to show interaction with the buttons.

The second file, zen2.html, shows a more chaotic webpage that includes a background with many repeated gifs, bright font, and a sidebar positioned to the right of the content.

The difference in style and layout of the two respective webpages reflects the power of CSS. Without altering the html files (other than altering their respective stylesheets), the webpages appear completely different, despite technically being the same.
