		<h3> Computer Science Autobiography</h3>
		<li>I first started using a computer when I was probably 8 years old. Since then, I haven't stopped. In this day and age, it's almost impossible not to use computers.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Right now I only use Mac. Once my current Mac Air breaks, I might get a Microsoft Surface or something similar.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Computer scientists can do a number of things. Reasearch, programming, software development, consulting, and teaching are some activities they do. However, the skills that one learns by studying Computer Science have far broader implications. Someone who is well versed in the fundementals of Computer Science can do whatever they want -- <i id="highlight">Computer Science teaches problem solving and organization above all else.</i></li>
		<br>
		<li>I'm interested in Computer Science because it is applicable to every aspect of the modern world. Technology is changing the way the world works and how people interact. I want to learn web development so that I can build a personal website and understand user interfaces better.</li>
		<br>
		<li>A general understanding of how programming languages work is important, as well as some sense of visual design to make your website look appealing is important.</li>
		<br>
		<li>I see myself using computers for the rest of my life. Society is already completely reliant on computers for everyday life. As computers become more powerful, they will beome more useful and applicable to different aspects of life.</li>
