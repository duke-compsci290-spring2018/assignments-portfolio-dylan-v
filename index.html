	<h2> Computer Science Autobiography</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>I first started using a computer when I was probably 8 years old</li>
		<li>I have used Mac and PCs</li>
		<li>I use a Mac Air on a daily basis</li>
		<li>Computer scientists can do a number of things. Reasearch, programming, software development, consulting, teaching are some activities they do.</li>
		<li>I'm interested in CS because it is applicable to every aspect of the modern world. Technology is changing the way the world works and how people interact. I want to learn web development so that I can build a personal website and understand user interfaces better.</li>
		<li>A general understanding of how programming languages work is important, as well as some sense of visual design to make your website look appealing is important.</li>
		<li>I see myself using computers for the rest of my life. Society is already completely reliant on computers for everyday life. As computers become more powerful, they will beome more useful and applicable to different aspects of life.</li>
