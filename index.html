  <h3> Computer Science Autobiography</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="question">When did you first start using a computer?</span><br>I first started using a computer when I was probably 8 years old. Since then, I haven't stopped. In this day and age, it's almost impossible not to use computers.</li>
    <li><span class="question">What kinds of computers have you used?</span><br>Right now I only use Mac. Once my current Mac Air breaks, I might get a Microsoft Surface or something similar.</li>
    <li><span class="question">How do you use computers on a daily basis?</span><br>I use my computer to manage my life (calendar, agenda, email), read the news, look at memes, program, design graphics, and play videogames.</li>
    <li><span class="question">What do you think a computer scientist does on a daily basis?</span><br>Computer scientists can do a number of things. Reasearch, programming, software development, consulting, and teaching are some activities they do. However, the skills that one learns by studying computer science have far broader implications. Someone who is well versed in the fundementals of computer science can do whatever they want -- <i id="highlight">computer science teaches problem solving and organization above all else.</i></li>
    <li><span class="question">What event(s) made you interested in studying computer science and this course in particular?</span><br>I've always been interested in technology and design, so studying computer science seemed like the logical choice. I'm interested in computer science because it is applicable to every aspect of the modern world. Technology is changing the way the world works and how people interact. I want to learn web development so that I can build a personal website and understand user interfaces better.</li>
    <li><span class="question">What kinds of skills are required to code different parts of a web site?</span><br>A general understanding of how programming languages work is important. It's also important to have a sense of visual design so your website looks appealing and is easy to use.</li>
    <li><span class="question">How do you see yourself using computers in the future?</span><br>I see myself using computers for the rest of my life. Society is already completely reliant on computers for everyday life. As computers become more powerful, they will beome more useful and applicable to different aspects of life.</li>
