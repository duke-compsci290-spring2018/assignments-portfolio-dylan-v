Dylan Vanelli - dgv3
Overall, I spent about 15 hours on this project. Most of my time spent was figuring out how to use Vue. Once I got comfortable with Vue, I found that front-end development was much easier (compared to say JQuery). My main difficulty was getting Firebase to work. I think that I've learned a good amount from this project in terms of backend development, but don't have a lot to show for it in terms of features. However, I was able to make a working Trello-like application. The features are outlines below.

Features:
-Add/delete boards
-Change title of boards
-Rearrange boards (left and right controls)
-Add/delete cards to boards
-Add any number of comments to cards
-Toggle card visibility within boards (hide them if you want)
-Toggle card information
-Add descriptions to cards
-Change background color
-View cards vertically or horizontalls
