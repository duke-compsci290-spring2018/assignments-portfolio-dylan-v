(Basic Version)

Dylan Vanelli - dgv3
So far, I've spent about 8 hours building this app. The hardest part was figuring out how to use Vue. However, now I see the power of the framework. I still need to implement a lot of features. Coming soon: change the color of a specific board, and other assignment specs.

TODO: More features. Validate HTML/CSS/JS.

Current features:
+Add tasks to a board
+Remove tasks from a board
+Move tasks between boards
+Edit the board title (font is directly editable)
