(Basic Version)

I went to office hours a few times to understand how to use Vue. I still feel that I can not fully utilizing it, but I have started to grasp it.
So far, I've spent about 8 hours building this app. The hardest part was figuring out how to use Vue. However, now I see the power of the framework. I still need to implement a lot of features.

Current features:
+Add tasks to a board
+Remove tasks from a board
+Move tasks between boards
+Edit the board title (font is directly editable)

TODO (for version 2): add multiple boards. Add descriptions to tasks (requires a modification to task data structure). Add comments for tasks. Add color customization for boards.
