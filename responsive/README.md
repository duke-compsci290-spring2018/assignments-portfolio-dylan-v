# assign_responsive

In this assignment I stripped down a site built on Bootstrap in order to create my own responsive portfolio. Some of the thigns that I got experience withing with were responsive grids and the @media function. When you resize the browser window, the colors of the background, header (jumbotron), and footer will change. This is a good way to test the @media screen and (max-width: ) functionality. Bootstrap and @media are really important for modern web/app design because users access sites from multiple different devices with different screen sizes. Today, more users access the web from their phones, so web design account for this.

When the screen size is 800px, the background/header/footer becomes blue and yellow. When the screen is 600px, the background/header/footer become purple and orange. Finally, when the screen size is 500px, the background/header/footer becomes red and light blue. Additionally, the graphics I included from my personal portfolio, as well as the free puppy stock photos, scale according to the screen size, which is a native feature of Bootstrap's grid system. When stripping down my example site (listed on my homepage), I removed most of the pre-existing containers and modified a few more. The result is that I created a webpage based on a Bootstrap template that is visually and programatically different from the original, but still relies on the same technology.
