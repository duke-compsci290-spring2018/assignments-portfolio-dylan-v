# assign_responsive

In this assignment I worked with a bootstrap framework in order to create a responsive portfolio. The images occupy 100% of the container that they are placed in and scale according to the dimensions of the screen. When the screen reaches specific widths, the background and font color change. This is a strong example of the @media feature in CSS which is useful and important for responsive design.
