In this project I explored the Three.js library. I have created an application that allows a user to interact with a pulsating orb. In this project, I learned about 3D rendering and game loops. Three.js provides a way to create a scene by establishing objects, lighting, and cameras within a WebGLRenderer object. A large part of 3D rendering, especially with animation, is the idea of a game loop. In this loop, values are updated to give the application the appearance of live motion, when in reality it is a sequence of quickly changing frames. The animation of the orb was made possible by using the Tween.js component of the library. Controls include the ability to zoom in/out and the ability to rotate the orb.
